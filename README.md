Crop Yield Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict crop yields based on key agricultural and environmental factors such as average rainfall, pesticide usage, temperature, and area of cultivation. The model is trained using historical data and can be used to forecast future crop yields by inputting expected or forecasted values. The web-based interface allows users to input relevant data and receive real-time yield predictions. This tool is designed for farmers, agricultural planners, and researchers to assist in crop management and decision-making.
